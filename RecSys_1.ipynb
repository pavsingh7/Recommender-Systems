    "# Recommender Systems 1\n",
    "### Pavan Singh - MSc Advanced Analytics - 2023\n",
    "#### An Introduction to Recommender Systems in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        The objective of a RecSys is to recommend relevant items for users, based on their preference. Preference and relevance are subjective, and they are generally inferred by items users have consumed previously\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "As previously discussed in the README.md file, there are three main families of methods for RecSys, these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collaborative Filtering**: This method makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person `A` has the same opinion as a person `B` on a set of items, A is more likely to have B's opinion for a given item than that of a randomly chosen person.\n",
    "    * Imagine that there is a website that sells books, and we have data on which books each user has purchased. We can use this data to build a recommendation system that suggests books to users based on the purchases of other similar users. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Content-Based Filtering**: This method uses only information about the description and attributes of the items users has previously consumed to model user's preferences. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended.\n",
    "    * Imagine that there is a website that sells books, and each book has a number of attributes, such as the author, the publisher, and the genre. We can use these attributes to build a recommendation system that suggests books to users based on their past preferences. So we, for example, look at the attributes of the books person `A` has purchased and recommend similar books to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hybrid methods**: Recent research has demonstrated that a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering could be more effective than pure approaches in some cases. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem.\n",
    "    * Imagine that there is a website that sells books, and each book has a number of attributes, such as the author, the publisher, and the genre. We also have data on which books each user has purchased. We can use this data to build a recommendation system that combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. So first we can use content-based filtering to recommend books to user `A` based on the attributes of the books they have purchased. Then we can also use collaborative filtering to recommend books to user `A` based on the purchases of other similar users. We can then combine recommendations using various methods to give one list.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "# Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate how to implement **Collaborative Filtering**, **Content-Based Filtering** and **Hybrid methods** in Python, for the task of providing personalized recommendations to the users. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We make use of a data  set available on Kaggle: [*Articles sharing and reading from CI&T DeskDrop*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gspmoreira/articles-sharing-reading-from-cit-deskdrop?select=users_interactions.csv). The dataset contains logs of users interactions on shared articles for the purpose of content Recommender Systems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is useful as it contains additional item attributes, which would allow the application of Content-Based filtering techniques or Hybrid approaches, as well as collaborative filtering methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "- contains a real sample of 12 months logs (Mar. 2016 - Feb. 2017) from CI&T's Internal Communication platform (DeskDrop).\n",
    "- It contains about 73k logged users interactions on more than 3k public articles shared in the platform.\n",
    "- two csv files, `shared_articles.csv`, `users_interactions.csv`\n",

    "# Evaluation Pre-Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation is important for machine learning projects, because it allows to compare objectivelly different algorithms and hyperparameter choices for models. TO prepare for evaluation of our models - i.e., ensuring that the trained model generalizes for data it was not trained on - we shall make use of a holdout dataset. Here, a random data sample (20% in this case) are kept aside in the training process, and exclusively used for evaluation. All evaluation metrics reported here are computed using the test set.\n",

    "## Data Splitting for Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we refer to this tehcnique as **cross-validation holdout**. It is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It is a method of splitting the available data into three sets: training, validation, and test. The holdout method is one of the simplest way of performing cross-validation. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model and tune its parameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation set is particularly important for preventing overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model is trained too well on the training set and performs poorly on new, unseen data. By using a separate validation set to evaluate the model during training, we can detect overfitting and adjust the model accordingly, before using the test set to evaluate the final performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: a more robust evaluation approach could be to split train and test sets by a reference date, where the train set is composed by all interactions before that date, and the test set are interactions after that date. For the sake of simplicity, we chose the first random approach for this notebook. "
