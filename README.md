## Types

There are several different types of recommender systems:

- Content-Based Recommenders: These systems recommend items to a user based on their past preferences. For example, if a user has previously purchased a number of science fiction books, a content-based recommender might recommend additional science fiction books to them.

- Collaborative Filtering Recommenders: These systems take into account the preferences of multiple users when making recommendations. For example, if two users have both purchased a number of mystery novels and a number of science fiction books, a collaborative filtering recommender might recommend a science fiction book to one user and a mystery novel to the other user.

- Hybrid Recommenders: These systems use a combination of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to make recommendations.
