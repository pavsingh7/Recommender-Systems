A series of scripts and notebooks with resources pertaining to all things RecSys. 

## Recommender Systems

A Recommender System, or a Recommendation System, is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas, but are most commonly recognized as playlist generators for video and music services, product recommenders for online stores, or content recommenders for social media platforms.

Specifically, RecSys are applied for various purposes:

- E-commerce: Recommender systems are often used to recommend products to customers on e-commerce websites.

- Media streaming: Recommender systems are used to recommend movies, TV shows, and music to users on streaming platforms.

- Social media: Recommender systems are used to recommend content, such as articles, videos, and photos, to users on social media platforms.

- Online advertising: Recommender systems can be used to personalize the advertisements that a user sees online.

- Job recommendations: Some job search websites use recommender systems to recommend job openings to job seekers.

- Educational recommendations: Educational platforms may use recommender systems to recommend courses or learning materials to students.

Current trends in recommender systems include the use of deep learning techniques, the incorporation of contextual information (such as location or time of day), and the use of interactive interfaces that allow users to provide feedback and help improve the recommendations being made.

## Types

There are several different types of recommender systems:

- Content-Based Recommenders: These systems recommend items to a user based on their past preferences. For example, if a user has previously purchased a number of science fiction books, a content-based recommender might recommend additional science fiction books to them.

- Collaborative Filtering Recommenders: These systems take into account the preferences of multiple users when making recommendations. For example, if two users have both purchased a number of mystery novels and a number of science fiction books, a collaborative filtering recommender might recommend a science fiction book to one user and a mystery novel to the other user.

- Hybrid Recommenders: These systems use a combination of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to make recommendations.

There are several other types which are'n't discussed in great detail here.
