    "        The objective of a RecSys is to recommend relevant items for users, based on their preference. Preference and relevance are subjective, and they are generally inferred by items users have consumed previously\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "There are three main families of methods for RecSys, these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collaborative Filtering**: This method makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person `A` has the same opinion as a person `B` on a set of items, `A` is more likely to have `B`'s opinion for a given item than that of a randomly chosen person.\n",
    "    * Imagine that there is a website that sells books, and we have data on which books each user has purchased. We can use this data to build a recommendation system that suggests books to users based on the purchases of other similar users. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Content-Based Filtering**: This method uses only information about the description and attributes of the items users has previously consumed to model user's preferences. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended.\n",
    "    * Imagine that there is a website that sells books, and each book has a number of attributes, such as the author, the publisher, and the genre. We can use these attributes to build a recommendation system that suggests books to users based on their past preferences. So we, for example, look at the attributes of the books person `A` has purchased and recommend similar books to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hybrid methods**: Recent research has demonstrated that a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering could be more effective than pure approaches in some cases. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem.\n",
    "    * Imagine that there is a website that sells books, and each book has a number of attributes, such as the author, the publisher, and the genre. We also have data on which books each user has purchased. We can use this data to build a recommendation system that combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. So first we can use content-based filtering to recommend books to user `A` based on the attributes of the books they have purchased. Then we can also use collaborative filtering to recommend books to user `A` based on the purchases of other similar users. We can then combine recommendations using various methods to give one list.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "# Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate how to implement **Collaborative Filtering**, **Content-Based Filtering** and **Hybrid methods** in Python, for the task of providing personalized recommendations to the users. \n",
    "\n",

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We make use of a data  set available on Kaggle: [*Articles sharing and reading from CI&T DeskDrop*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gspmoreira/articles-sharing-reading-from-cit-deskdrop?select=users_interactions.csv). The dataset contains logs of users interactions on shared articles for the purpose of content Recommender Systems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is useful as it contains additional item attributes, which would allow the application of Content-Based filtering techniques or Hybrid approaches, as well as collaborative filtering methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "- contains a real sample of 12 months logs (Mar. 2016 - Feb. 2017) from CI&T's Internal Communication platform (DeskDrop).\n",
    "- It contains about 73k logged users interactions on more than 3k public articles shared in the platform.\n",

    "Evaluation is important for machine learning projects, because it allows to compare objectivelly different algorithms and hyperparameter choices for models. TO prepare for evaluation of our models - i.e., ensuring that the trained model generalizes for data it was not trained on - we shall make use of a holdout dataset. Here, a random data sample (20% in this case) are kept aside in the training process, and exclusively used for evaluation. All evaluation metrics reported here are computed using the test set.\n",

    "## Data Splitting for Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we refer to this technique as **cross-validation holdout**. It is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It is a method of splitting the available data into three sets: training, validation, and test. The holdout method is one of the simplest way of performing cross-validation. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model and tune its parameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation set is particularly important for preventing overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model is trained too well on the training set and performs poorly on new, unseen data. By using a separate validation set to evaluate the model during training, we can detect overfitting and adjust the model accordingly, before using the test set to evaluate the final performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: a more robust evaluation approach could be to split train and test sets by a reference date, where the train set is composed by all interactions before that date, and the test set are interactions after that date. For the sake of simplicity, we chose the first random approach for this notebook. "

    "##  Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several evaluations metrics in RecSys. Some are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: This metric measures the average difference between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings. It is a common metric for regression problems, and it is often used to evaluate the performance of collaborative filtering models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: This metric measures the average of the squared differences between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings. It is similar to MAE but it places more weight on large errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: This metric is calculated as the square root of the MSE. It is a more interpretable metric than MSE, since it is in the same unit as the ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top-N Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to work with **Top-N accuracy** metrics, which evaluates the accuracy of the top (N) recommendations provided to a user (generated by the model), comparing to the items the user has actually interacted in test set. This metric is **often used when the goal is to recommend a small set of items to a user, rather than predicting a rating for each item**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation method works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each user, the algorithm selects a set of items that the user has interacted with in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each item in that set, it samples 100 other items that the user has not interacted with. The assumption is that these non-interacted items are not relevant to the user, but this might not be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It then asks the recommender model to produce a ranked list of recommended items from a set that includes one interacted item and the 100 non-interacted items.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Next step is computing the Top-N accuracy metric for this user and interacted item from the ranked list of recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, it aggregates the global Top-N accuracy metrics by calculating the mean across all users and items.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is a way to evaluate how well the model is able to rank the items that a user has interacted with among a set of other items that the user has not interacted with.
